## Overview

DrawlScan is a CUI-based network watcher tool written in Go.
It captures packets from a specified network interface and visualizes their structure and origin using ASCII art, GeoIP, and reverse DNS lookup.

It’s like tcpdump, but with an artistic flair.

Key Features:  
    •   🎨 Visualize packet structures (Ethernet/IP/TCP/UDP/etc.) as ASCII diagrams  
    •   🌍 GeoIP-based source/destination display  
    •   🧭 Lightweight, TUI-style interface — no GUI required  
    •   🐧 Perfect for learning, demos, or simply keeping an eye on your machine
